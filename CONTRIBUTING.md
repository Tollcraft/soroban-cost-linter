# Contributing to `soroban-cost-linter`

First off, thank you for considering contributing to `soroban-cost-linter`!

## How to Contribute

### 1. Understanding the Architecture

This tool leverages Dylint to hook into the Rust compiler's AST and High-Level Intermediate Representation (HIR). Familiarity with `rustc` internals (like `rustc_hir`, `rustc_middle`) and `clippy` source code is highly beneficial.

### 2. Setting up Locally

1. Install Dylint:

   ```bash
   cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link
   ```

2. Clone the repository and build:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. Run tests:

   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

### 3. Adding a New Lint

- Find a structural anti-pattern in Soroban that is input-independent and costly.
- Write a failing test case in the `ui` tests directory.
- Implement the lint using the `dylint` framework, checking the AST or HIR for the specific pattern.
- Update the documentation and `README.md`.

### Lint Naming Convention

Lint names are part of the project's public API. They appear in `#[allow(...)]`, `#[warn(...)]`, `#[deny(...)]`, and `budget.toml`, so renaming a shipped lint is a breaking change and should be avoided.

When adding new lints:

- Use lowercase `snake_case`.
- Prefer names that describe the code pattern being detected rather than expressing a judgement about the code.
- Use consistent suffixes such as `_in_loop` for loop-specific patterns.
- Avoid a `soroban_` prefix unless it is needed to avoid ambiguity with another well-known lint name.

Examples:

| Preferred | Avoid |
| ---------- | ----- |
| `storage_in_loop` | `soroban_storage_in_loop` |
| `env_clone` | `redundant_env_clone` |
| `host_function_in_loop` | `unnecessary_host_function_call` |

### Existing lint names

The existing lint names:

- `soroban_storage_in_loop`
- `redundant_env_clone`
- `unnecessary_host_function_call`

are already part of the public interface. Although they do not fully match the convention above, they are retained as legacy names because renaming shipped lints would be a breaking change for users.

### 4. Code Quality Standards

All PRs are checked by CI, and these checks must pass before a PR can be merged. Run them locally before pushing:

1. Format your code with rustfmt (CI rejects unformatted code):

   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all
   ```

2. Make sure Clippy passes with no warnings:

   ```bash
   cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
   ```

3. Make sure the test suite passes:

   ```bash
   cargo test --workspace
   ```

Follow the patterns already used in the codebase: `soroban_cost_lints` uses edition 2024, so prefer let-chains (`if let ... && let ...`) over nested `if let` blocks, and match the structure of the existing lint passes when adding a new lint.

### 5. Submitting a Pull Request

- Ensure your PR targets the `main` branch.
- Make sure the checks in the section above (`cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`) all pass.
- Provide a clear description of what the lint does and why it saves costs.
- If your pull request includes a user-visible change, add an appropriate entry under the **Unreleased** section of `CHANGELOG.md`. The entry will be moved into the next versioned release when a release is cut.
